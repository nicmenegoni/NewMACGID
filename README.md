# NewMACGID
New Multi-methodological Approach for Composition of Garnet In Diamond

In 2015, I developed this code for my Master's thesis titled 'Semi-quantitative analysis of garnet still trapped in lithospheric diamonds: a non-destructive approach' (supervision: Fabrizio Nestola).
NewMACGID improves  the MIRAGEM algorithm presented by Bersani et al. (2009), which performs a semi-quantitative analysis of garnets based on their Raman spectra, including  the data acquired from the Single Crystal X-Ray Diffraction (and  consequent structural refinement) as site occupancy and bond length.
